**Introduction :**  
MailEnable is an e-mail server distributed by MailEnable Pty based on Windows. The features of MailEnable include support for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP email protocols, with the support of SSL / TLS and the list server. The management functionality can be used by the Microsoft Management Console or the browser. The functionality of MailEnables can be implemented by using MMAP.
