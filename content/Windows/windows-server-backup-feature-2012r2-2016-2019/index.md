## Introduction

[Windows Server Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj614621(v=ws.11)) (WSB) is a feature that provides backup and recovery options for Windows server environments. Windows Server Backup is a feature that provides a set of wizards and other tools for you to perform basic backup and recovery tasks for the server it is installed on. Administrators can use Windows Server Backup to back up a full server, the system state, selected storage volumes or specific files or folders, as long as the data volume is less than 2 terabytes. Windows Server Backup replaced the Ntbackup feature in earlier Windows Server operating systems.
