In this article, you will learn how to check Disk Utilization in details in Windows. **WinDirStat** is a free and open-source graphical disk usage analyzer for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows). It presents a sub-tree view with disk-use percentage alongside a usage-sorted list of file extensions that is interactively integrated with a colorful graphical display (a treemap). Created as an open-source project released under the GNU GPL, it was developed using Visual C++/MFC 7.0 and distributed using SourceForge. The project was inspired by SequoiaView, an application based on research done by the Visualization Section of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven.
