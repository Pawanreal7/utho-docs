**An RDS CAL license is also known as a Remote Deskto Service Client Access License. It allows multiple users to access the server concurrently. A user can perform their own task in their RDP session.**

_We will have a brief explanation of the license installation process._

**Step 1:** We need to install the role for Remote Desktop Services. We can install the role from the server manager option. Please have a look at the below screenshot.
