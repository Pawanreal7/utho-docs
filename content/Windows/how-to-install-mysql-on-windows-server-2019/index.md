## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install MySQL on Windows Server 2019.

MySQL is a database that can be downloaded for free and is used by many people. It is a relational database management system that is used by a lot of people. Even though Linux servers use it more often, it works just as well with Windows Servers.

## Install MySQL

**Step 1: Start by installing the [Windows Server 2019 MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Select the version that fits on your machine, then click Download.**

## MySQL Installer Setup

**Step 1: When you ran the programme in the last step, a new window came up with the MySQL Installer setup. It asks you which MySQL items you want to put on the host.**

**One choice is to choose the setup type that is already set up and fits your needs. Here's a quick look at each mode:**

Developer Default: Installs MySQL Server, Shell, Router, Workbench, MySQL for Visual Studio, MySQL Connectors (for.NET, Python, ODBC, Java, and C++), MySQL Documentation, and MySQL Samples and Examples.

Server only: Only puts the MySQL server in place. This type of setup runs the GA (general availability) or development release server you chose when you downloaded MySQL Installer. It uses the download and data paths that are set by default.

Client only: Only downloads the latest MySQL applications and MySQL connectors. This setup type is similar to the Developer Default type, but it does not include the MySQL server or the client programmes that usually come with it, such as MySQL or mysqladmin.

Full: Installs all available MySQL tools.

Custom: With the custom setup type, you can search for and choose specific MySQL items from the MySQL Installer collection.

For this article, select Server only.

**This mistake happens because MySQL Bin has not been added to the path. To find where the MySQL Bin is, use the File Manager to go to This PC. Then go to C drive > Program Files > MySQL > MySQL Server 8.0 > bin. Right-click on "bin" in the bar at the top and choose "Copy address."**

```
# cd C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\bin

```

**And then run the following to access your MySQL**.

```
# mysql -u root -p

```
