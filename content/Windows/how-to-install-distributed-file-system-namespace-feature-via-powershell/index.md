INTRODUCTION

[DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_File_System_(Microsoft)) is a set of client and server services that allow an organization using Microsoft Windows servers to organize many scattered SMB file shares into a distributed file system. DFS has two components to its service: Location transparency and Redundancy. Basically a distributed file system (DFS) isÂ **a file system that spans across multiple file servers or multiple locations**, such as file servers that are situated in different physical places. Files are accessible just as if they were stored locally, from any device and from anywhere on the network.
