### INTRODUCTION

**Windows Deployment Services** (**WDS**) is a deprecated component of the [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server) operating system that enables centralized, network-based deploy of operating systems to bare-metal computers. It is the successor to Remote Installation Services (RIS). WDS officially supports remote deployment of Windows Vista and later, as well as Windows Server 2008 and later. However, because WDS uses disk imaging, in particular the Windows Imaging Format (WIM), it could deploy virtually any operating system. This is in contrast with its predecessor, RIS, which was a method of automating the installation process.
