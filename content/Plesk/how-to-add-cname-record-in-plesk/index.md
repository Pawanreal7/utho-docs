## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to add CNAME record in Plesk.

Inside the Domain Name System ([DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)), there is a specific kind of resource record known as a Canonical Name (CNAME) record. This record transfers one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical name).

Step 1. Log into your Plesk with your server password by searching server\_ip:8880 in your browser.

Step 4. Select CNAME record from the record type drop-down menu.

Enter the subdomain name in the domain name field; in our case, we used www.

In the TTL field, you can assign any value in seconds; we have entered 3600.

In the canonical name field, I entered the canonical name as micro.com for the main domain. then select OK.Â 

NOTE: Use your main domain instead of micro.com.
