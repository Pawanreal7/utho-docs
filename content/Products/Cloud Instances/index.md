# Cloud Instances

Cloud instances refer to virtual machines (VMs) or servers that are hosted in a cloud computing environment. Instead of running on physical hardware that's located on-premises, these instances run on servers provided by a cloud service provider.

### Cloud Instances offer several benefits:

-   Scalability
-   Flexibility
-   Accessibility
-   Reliability
-   Pay-as-you-go pricing
