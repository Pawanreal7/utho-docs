Weekly backup is a system level backup in which an image copy of complete server is created. You can not retrieve a single file from the weekly backup. To retrieve a single file from backup you need to create a new server and then retrieve the file from server.

1\. At first, you need to login [Microhost Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.microhost.com/)

2\. Select the cloud server for which you want to enable backup.

3\. When you click on “Manage cloud” option , A window will appear shown in the image below. You need to select “Backup” option and then click on “Enable Backup”.
