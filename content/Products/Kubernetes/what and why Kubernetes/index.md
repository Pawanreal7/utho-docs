# Kubernetes
--- 
Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s for its abbreviation pattern (K-eight-s), is an open-source platform designed to oversee containerized applications in diverse environments, including private, public, and hybrid clouds. It's widely utilized for managing microservice architectures and can be deployed across various cloud providers.

Kubernetes empowers application developers, IT system administrators, and DevOps engineers to automate the deployment, scaling, maintenance, scheduling, and operation of multiple application containers across node clusters. While containers share a common operating system (OS) on host machines, they remain isolated from each other by default, unless explicitly connected by a user.



### Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do

Containers offer a convenient way to package and execute applications. However, in a production setup, managing these containers and ensuring continuous operation is crucial. For instance, when a container crashes, another should swiftly take its place. Wouldn't it be convenient if this process were automated?

Enter Kubernetes! Kubernetes offers a robust framework for running distributed systems with resilience. It handles tasks like scaling, failover management, and deploying patterns for your applications. For instance, Kubernetes effortlessly orchestrates canary deployments, enabling seamless updates for your system.


### Kubernetes offer several benefits:
**Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Easily expose containers using DNS names or IP addresses, and Kubernetes efficiently distributes network traffic to maintain deployment stability.


- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mount storage systems of your choice, including local storage and various public cloud providers.


- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:** Describe your container's desired state, and Kubernetes smoothly transitions it to the specified state at a controlled pace. This includes creating new containers, removing existing ones, and transferring resources seamlessly.


- **Automatic Bin Packing:** Specify CPU and memory requirements for containers, and Kubernetes optimizes resource usage by efficiently allocating containers to nodes within your cluster.


- **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes ensures the reliability of your containers by automatically restarting or replacing failed containers and handling unresponsive ones, ensuring they're ready to serve before being advertised to clients.


- **Secret and Configuration Management:** Securely store and manage sensitive information like passwords and tokens, deploy and update secrets and configurations without rebuilding container images, and maintain confidentiality in your stack configuration.


- **Batch Execution:** Kubernetes effectively manages batch and CI workloads, replacing failed containers as needed.


- **Horizontal Scaling:** Easily scale your application up or down using simple commands, a user-friendly interface, or automatic scaling based on CPU usage.


- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack:** Allocate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services, ensuring compatibility across different network protocols.


- **Extensibility:** Extend the capabilities of your Kubernetes cluster by adding features without the need to modify the upstream source code.


### How Kubernetes works

Kubernetes simplifies managing a cluster of computing instances by handling container deployment and scaling. Containers are organized into logical groups called pods, allowing you to run and scale one or multiple containers together.
The Kubernetes control plane software takes care of crucial tasks like determining when and where to deploy your pods, managing traffic routing, and adjusting pod scaling based on resource utilization or other metrics you specify. It automatically initiates pods on your cluster according to their resource needs and restarts them if either the pods or the instances they run on encounter failures.
Each pod receives its own IP address and a unique DNS name, which Kubernetes utilizes for connecting your services internally and routing external traffic. This streamlined approach ensures seamless communication and management within your Kubernetes environment.


### Kubernetes Advantages

The Kubernetes platform offers several key advantages that have contributed to its widespread adoption:
- **Portability:** Containers are easily transportable across various environments, from virtual setups to bare metal. Since Kubernetes is supported on major public clouds, you can run containerized applications on Kubernetes in diverse environments.


- **Integration and Extensibility:** Kubernetes seamlessly integrates with existing solutions such as logging, monitoring, and alerting services. Additionally, the Kubernetes community actively develops open-source solutions that complement Kubernetes, resulting in a robust and rapidly expanding ecosystem.


- **Cost Efficiency:** Kubernetes optimizes resource usage, automates scaling, and provides flexibility to run workloads where they're most beneficial, giving you control over your IT spending.
Scalability: Cloud-native applications scale horizontally, and Kubernetes employs auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically spin up additional container instances and scale out in response to demand.


- **API-Based:** Kubernetes operates on a REST API foundation, enabling comprehensive control over the Kubernetes environment through programming.


- **Simplified CI/CD:** Kubernetes facilitates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications to production environments. Enterprises are integrating Kubernetes with CI/CD to establish scalable pipelines that dynamically adapt to workload demands.


### Common Kubernetes terms

Here are some key Kubernetes terms that can help you understand how Kubernetes operates:

- **Cluster:** The core of the Kubernetes engine, where containerized applications run. It consists of a group of machines that manage and execute applications.


- **Node:** Worker machines within a cluster that execute tasks.


- **Pod:** Collections of containers deployed together on the same host machine to perform related tasks.


- **Replication Controller:** An abstraction used to manage the lifecycle of pods, ensuring a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.


- **Selector:** A system used to find and categorize specific resources based on predefined criteria.


- **Label:** Key-value pairs assigned to resources for filtering, organizing, and performing operations on resource sets.


- **Annotation:** Similar to labels but with a larger data capacity, annotations provide additional information about resources.


- **Ingress:** An API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically for HTTP traffic. It facilitates name-based virtual hosting, load balancing, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) termination.
