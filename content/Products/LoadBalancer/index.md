# LoadBalancer
--- 
Load balancing means spreading out incoming network traffic across a bunch of backend servers or resources.

Load Balancer works at layer 4 of the OSI model. Think of it as the middleman between clients and servers. When traffic comes in, the load balancer sends it to different backend servers based on rules you set up, like how healthy each server is. These backend servers could be Utho Virtual Machines or part of a Virtual Machine Scale Set.


### Why use Load Balancer?

With Load Balancer, you can easily scale your applications and ensure they stay available. It supports both inbound and outbound traffic scenarios, offering fast response times and high data transfer rates. Plus, it can handle millions of connections for all TCP and UDP applications.

Here are some key things you can do with Load Balancer:
- Balance both internal and external traffic to Utho virtual machines.
- Improve reliability by spreading resources across different zones.
- Set up outbound connections for virtual machines.
- Monitor the health of your balanced resources using health probes.
- Access virtual machines in your network through public IP addresses and ports using port forwarding.
- Support IPv6 for load balancing.
- Balance services across multiple ports, IP addresses or both.


### Types of Load Balancers â€“ Based on Functions
Various load-balancing techniques exist to tackle specific network issues.

1. **Network Load Balancer (Layer 4 - L4):**

    Network Load Balancers distribute traffic based on network variables like IP addresses and destination ports. They operate at the transport layer (TCP - level 4), making routing decisions without considering application-level parameters such as content type, cookies, or headers. These balancers focus solely on network layer information to direct traffic.

2. **Application Load Balancer (Layer 7 - L7):**

    Application Load Balancers, at the highest level of the OSI model, distribute requests based on various application-level parameters. They analyze a broader range of data, including HTTP headers and SSL sessions, to distribute server load based on multiple variables. This enables them to manage server traffic based on individual usage and behavior.

3. **Global Server Load Balancer (Multi-site Load Balancer)**

    Global Server Load Balancers (GSLBs) extend the capabilities of L4 and L7 load balancers across multiple data centers, especially in cloud environments. They efficiently distribute load globally, ensuring optimal performance for end users across different geographical locations. Additionally, they facilitate quick recovery and seamless business operations in case of server disasters by redirecting traffic to alternative data centers.
**Understanding Load Balancing Algorithms**

    Load balancing algorithms consist of rules guiding a load balancer in selecting the optimal server for various client requests. These algorithms are broadly categorized into two main types.


**Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms Explained:**
1. **Least Connection**

    Routes traffic to servers with the fewest open connections, assuming similar processing power for all connections.

2. **Weighted Least Connection**

    Allows assigning different weights to servers, accommodating varying connection-handling capacities.

3. **Weighted Response Time**

    Considers both server response time and active connections to direct traffic to servers with the quickest responses, ensuring faster service.

4. **Resource-Based**

    Distributes load based on available server resources like CPU and memory. A specialized software agent on each server measures resource availability, guiding the load balancer in traffic distribution.


**Static load balancing Algorithms Explained:**

Static Load Balancing Algorithms Explained:

1. **Round Robin:**

    - Distributes traffic to servers in rotation using the Domain Name System (DNS). Each DNS query receives a different server address.

2. **Weighted Round Robin:**

    - Lets administrators assign different weights to servers, allocating more traffic to those with higher capacity. Weighting is configurable within DNS records.
