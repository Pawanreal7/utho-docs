## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to access a server through password-less authentication.

[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network [protocol](https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/how-to-troubleshoot-with-nmap-in-centos/) that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.
