## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install Atom Text Editor on Debian 12.

[Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor))Â is a cross-platform text editor that is built on open source and does not cost anything to use. It is compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux-based operating systems such as Debian 12. It is also known as the hackable text editor in the technical generation that is currently living in the 21st century.

Because it supports a wide variety of add-ons, including dynamic linting, syntax highlighting for many languages and formats, debuggers, video and music player controls, and runtime environments, Atom is regarded as being more user-friendly than its rivals.
