## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install Red5 Server on Ubuntu 22.04.

[Red5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red5_(media_server)) is a media server that runs on open source software and may be used for live streaming solutions of any kind. It is built to be adaptable and has a straightforward plugin architecture, both of which make it possible to personalise practically any video on demand (VOD) or live streaming scenario. Red5 has been utilised by thousands of firms, including Amazon and Facebook, and it continues to be used today.

Red5 Pro is built on top of the Red5 Media Server as its primary underlying platform. It includes the frameworks for the server-side application and plug-ins, in addition to the fundamental streaming infrastructure that our solution depends on.

## Step 1: Install Java

**On your Ubuntu machine, you need to have Java version 11 or a later version installed at the very least. In the event that you do not already have Java installed on your system, you can use the following command to install OpenJDK.**

```
# apt update

```

```
# apt install default-jdk

```

**Additionally, ensure that the JAVA\_HOME environment variable is configured correctly on your machine. The JAVA\_HOME environment variable can be modified by using the command. Modify the directory path for the version of Java that you have installed.**

```
# echo 'export JAVA\_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/' >> /etc/bash.bashrc

```
