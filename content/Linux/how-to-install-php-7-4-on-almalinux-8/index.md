## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install PHP 7.4 on AlmaLinux 8.

[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) is an increasingly popular scripting language that may be used to a variety of different purposes, although it is most commonly utilised in web development. It serves as the fundamental component of the vast majority of blogging platforms, including WordPress, Drupal, Magento, and a great many others.

This tutorial will presume that you have at least a fundamental understanding of Linux, that you are familiar with the shell, and most crucially, that you host your website on a virtual private server (VPS). The installation is really straightforward, although it does make the assumption that you are logged in as the root user. If this is not the case, you may need to add "sudo" to the instructions in order to gain root access.
