In this article, we will learn how to install OwnCloud on RHEL 8 server. OwnCloud is a major open-source file sharing and cloud collaboration tool whose services and features are similar to those given by DropBox and Google Drive. However, unlike Dropbox, OwnCloud does not have the [datacenter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/what-is-a-data-center.html) capacity to store hosted files. Nevertheless, you can still share things such as papers, photos, and videos to name a few, and view them across multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs.

## Prerequisites

- Any normal user with SUDO privileges or super user

- LAMP installed on server. If you have installed LAMP, you can follow the below steps of this separate and [detailed guide](https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-10/)

### Setting up the database of Owncloud

Step 8: Now, login to your root user of mariadb using the password you have set perviously.

```
mysql -u root -p
```
```
CREATE DATABASE owncloud;
CREATE USER 'ownclouduser'@'localhost' identified by 'STRONG_PASSWORD';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON owncloud.* TO 'owncloud'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```
Step 9: Now, manage your trusted sites of your owncloud. This is the list of IP or domains, by which you want your owncloud accessible. This is generally the server' ip or domain pointed to the server on which install Owncloud.

```
cd /var/www/html/owncloud
vi config/config.php
```
<figure>

Step 10: Now, you are almost ready to access your owncloud server. You just need to restart the httpd services.

```
systemctl restart httpd
```
Step 11: If you faces any issue, you can find the below command usefull.

```
cd /var/www/html/owncloud
```
```
sudo -u apache ./occ maintenance:install \
```   --database "mysql" \
   --database-name "owncloud" \
   --database-user "ownclouduser"\
   --database-pass "password" 

```
systemctl restart httpd
```
And this is you will install owncloud on Rhel 8 server.
