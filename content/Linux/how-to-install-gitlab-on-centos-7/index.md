## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install GitLab on CentOS 7.

[GitLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab)Â is an open-source tool that makes it easy to manage repositories, issues, CI/CD pipelines, and much more. If you use CentOS 7 and want to set up your own GitLab instance to streamline your DevOps process, you're in the right place.

This step-by-step tutorial will show you how to install GitLab on CentOS 7. There are two versions of GitLab: Enterprise Edition (EE) and Community Edition (CE). We'll talk about the community version in this post.

##### Step 1: Update the System

**Let's start by updating the list of packages and upgrading any packages that are already installed to their most recent versions.**

```
# yum update -y
```


```
# yum upgrade -y
```

##### Step 2: Install Dependencies

**GitLab needs some other things to work properly. Use the following instructions to set them up:**

```
# yum install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates postfix

```

##### Step 3: Add GitLab Apt Repository

**Run the following curl command to add the GitLab project. It will instantly figure out what version of CentOS 7 you have and set the repository to match.**

```
# curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.rpm.sh | bash

```

**Run the command below to quickly install and set up gitlab-ce on your CentOS 7 system. Replace the server's hostname with the name of your setup.**

```
# EXTERNAL\_URL="http://gitlab.utho.net" yum install gitlab-ce

```

**Once the command above has been run properly, the output will look something like this:**

**The output shown above shows that GitLab has been set up correctly. The user name for the gitlab web interface is "root," and the password is saved at "/etc/gitlab/initial\_root\_password."**

##### Step 5: Access GitLab Web Interface

**Once GitLab is loaded and set up, open your web browser and type in the IP address or hostname of your server.**
