## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install GitLab on Debian 12.

[GitLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab)Â is an open-source tool that makes it easy to manage repositories, issues, CI/CD pipelines, and much more. If you use Debian 12 and want to set up your own GitLab instance to streamline your DevOps process, you're in the right place.

This step-by-step tutorial will show you how to install GitLab on Debian 12. There are two versions of GitLab: Enterprise Edition (EE) and Community Edition (CE). We'll talk about the community version in this post.

##### Step 1: Update the System

**Let's start by updating the list of packages and upgrading any packages that are already installed to their most recent versions.**

```
# apt update -y

```

```
# apt upgrade -y

```

##### Step 2: Install Dependencies

**GitLab needs some other things to work properly. Use the following instructions to set them up:**

```
# apt-get install curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https gnupg2 -y

```

##### Step 3: Add GitLab Apt Repository

**Run the following curl command to add the GitLab project. It will instantly figure out what version of Debian you have and set the repository to match.**

```
# curl -s https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | bash

```

##### Step 4: Install Gitlab

**Run the command below to quickly install and set up gitlab-ce on your Debian system.**

```
# apt-get install gitlab-ce -y

```

**Once the command above has been run properly, the output will look something like this:**

**The output shown above shows that GitLab has been set up correctly. The user name for the gitlab web interface is "root," and the password is saved at "/etc/gitlab/initial\_root\_password"**

##### Step 5: Configure GitLab

**After the installation is done, we will set up GitLab to meet our needs. Here are the changes you can make**.

```
# vi /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb

```

**Change your website name in the next line**.

```
external_url 'https://Your_Domain_Name'
```

**Save and close the file.**

**Let's now use the command below to update the repository**.

```
# gitlab-ctl reconfigure

```

##### Step 5: Access GitLab Web Interface

**Once GitLab is loaded and set up, open your web browser and type in the IP address or hostname of your server.**
