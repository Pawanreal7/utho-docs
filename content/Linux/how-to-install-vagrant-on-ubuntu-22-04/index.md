## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install Vagrant on Ubuntu 22.04.

[Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software)) provides DevOps with a variety of different development environments, which enables developers to work across a number of different operating systems. The fact that this tool can be installed on the vast majority of Linux distributions is one of the most appealing aspects of Vagrant. It is really necessary to be aware that Vagrant is a tool that is generated by a command line.

In addition, you need to install a virtualization engine on your machine, such as Hyper-V, VirtualBox, or Docker, to use the Vagrant tools. KVM and VMware are supported by the Vagrant plugin system as well.

##### **Step 1: Update packages**
