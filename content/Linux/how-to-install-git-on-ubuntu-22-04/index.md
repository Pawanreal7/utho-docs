## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install Git on Ubuntu 22.04.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)Â is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

Git is a piece of software that allows for the tracking of changes in any set of files, and it is typically used for the purpose of coordinating the work of multiple programmers who are working together on the development of source code for software. Git is both free and open source software. Speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches operating on various systems) are some of its goals.

#### Installing Git with Apt

```
# git config --global user.name "Your Name"

```

```
# git config --global user.email "youremail@utho.com"
