In this tutorial, we will learn how to install Snap on Debian 10 server. [Snaps are programmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)) that have all of their dependencies bundled and ready to run on all widely used Linux distributions from a single build. They automatically update and gracefully roll back.

The Snap Store, an app store with millions of users, allows users to find and download Snaps.

Snaps are safe because they are contained and sandboxed to prevent system compromise. They operate at various confinement levels, which refer to how isolated they are from one another and the base system. More significantly, each snap has a carefully chosen interface that the designer carefully considered depending on the requirements of the snap in order to enable access to particular system resources outside of its confinement, such as network access, desktop access, and more.
