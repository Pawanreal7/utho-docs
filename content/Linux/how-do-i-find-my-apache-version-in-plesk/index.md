- When it comes to web hosting and website management, Plesk utilises web servers. Plesk for Linux makes use of the Apache HTTP Server (http://httpd.apache.org/), which is then paired with the nginx reverse proxy server so that it may achieve higher levels of performance. IIS is the HTTP Server that is used by Plesk for Windows
