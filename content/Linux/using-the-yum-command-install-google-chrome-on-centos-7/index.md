**Description**

One of the most widely used web browsers now available is Google Chrome. It has a market share of over 62% and offers far higher levels of both security and performance compared to any other browser. On the other hand, it is not completely open source and instead built on top of the open source Chromium project. Using the yum command, this tutorial will walk you through the process of installing the stable version of Google Chrome on CentOS 7.

The following steps should be taken in order to install the application on your desktop running CentOS Linux:

## download Google Chrome

```
# wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm 
```

## yum command to install Chrome web browser

```
# sudo yum localinstall google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm 
```

## update Chrome

```
# sudo yum upgrade google-chrome-stable 
```

## CentOS 7 install Google Chrome

```
# wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm 
```
