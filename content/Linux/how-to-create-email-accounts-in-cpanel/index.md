This post will show you how to set up an email account in cPanels. You don't have an email account set up by default. Although the main username appears to be set up as an email account, if you want to use it, you must add it as an email account.

1-Login to the cpanel.  
2- Go to the email section and click on the Email account.

Username: Enter your email's username.

6-Click **+ Create** to finalize.

The same steps work for creating email accounts for your primary domain, addon domains, and subdomains. You cannot create email accounts with a script or via SSH.

Thank you!!
