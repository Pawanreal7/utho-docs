## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install MailCatcher On Ubuntu 22.04.

[MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) is a free programme that can monitor e-mails sent from any online or mobile application. It can do this by tracking the sender and the recipient of the messages. This programme acts as a fake Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server to which you can direct your messages rather than sending them to a real SMTP server.

It is important to keep in mind that emails sent in this manner will only be received by a local server and can be seen through a web interface. On the other hand, it's possible that these emails are simply never received.

## MailCatcher Features

Mailcatcher is able to assist you in conducting a comprehensive review of the contents as well as the titles of your email messages. You will be able to see the HTML version of an email and check to see if all of the headers, including the address for the Return-Path field, are correctly set using this tool. Before sending an email, you have the ability to test links, examine attachments, and pinpoint areas in which there is room for improvement.

Because using Mailcatcher is completely free, it might be appealing to you if you're operating on a very tight budget. Mailcatcher offers the capability to stop spam from reaching actual users of your application. You will have an easier time determining what actually works and what does not with the help of this tool.
