## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install PHP 8.2 on Ubuntu 22.04.

[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely used server programming language that is best recognised for its ability to create dynamic and interactive web pages. The first step in becoming proficient in programming is becoming familiar with the basics of the language of your choice.

The PHP scripting language is a general-purpose scripting language that can be used for web development.

##### Step 1: Update Packages

**When we initially start using a new system, the very first thing we need to do is update our repositories so that they are always up to date. Additionally, execute the upgrade command.**

```
# apt update

```

##### Step 2: Add the Ondrej sury repository to the PPA

**In order for PHP 8.2 to function properly on Ubuntu 22.04, we need to add the Ondrej sury PPA into the system. At the present time, this individual is responsible for maintaining the PHP repository. Because this PPA is not presently being reviewed, installing from it does not guarantee that all requirements will be met.**

**In our terminal, use the following command to add this PPA.**

```
# add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php

```

**After the installation is finished, we will need to do another update of the repository in order for the changes to take effect.**

```
# apt update

```

##### Step 3: Install PHP 8.2

**On our Ubuntu 22.04 Linux system, we should now be able to successfully install PHP 8.2. The commands that need to be executed are as follows:**

```
# apt install php8.2 -y

```
