## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install Rkhunter on Ubuntu 22.04.

[Rkhunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rkhunter), which is also known as Rootkit Hunter, is responsible for searching the system for rootkits. It is an open-source programme that has been developed specifically for Linux and operating systems that are based on Linux.

You can use the tool to safeguard your system from being attacked by third parties, maintain your privacy, and enhance its overall security. This programme investigates hidden files, potentially malicious strings, and incorrect permissions in binary files.

Rkhunter does a system scan to determine which rootkits are present by comparing the SHA-1 hashes found in local folders with those found in an online database. Because it is developed in Bash, which offers more portability, this programme is compatible with all UNIX-based operating systems.
