## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to install Webuzo on Fedora.

Webuzo is a control panel for multi-user shared hosting that enables users to simultaneously deploy a variety of apps and share server resources with other users. This is made possible by Webuzo's multi-user shared hosting model. You will gain the knowledge necessary to install Webuzo on Fedora by reading this post. Webuzo is a control panel for shared hosting that supports many users. Even if the user has no prior experience with or knowledge of technical administration, they are still able to install applications, manage domains, schedule jobs, build databases, and manage users thanks to the control panel's interactive management interface. This makes it possible for users to install applications, manage domains, schedule jobs, build databases, and manage users. This is due to the fact that the control panel is used to carry out activities such as the development of databases, the scheduling of jobs, the management of domains, and the installation of applications.
