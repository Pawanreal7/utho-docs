In this post, we'll talk more about how to install Drupal on [Fedora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux).

Drupal is a free and open-source content management system that lets us make and change websites without having to learn how to code. The source code for Drupal is written in PHP and is shared under the GNU General Public License (General Public License ).

## Prerequesties

- dnf server configured on your Fedora server
- Apache 2.x (Recommended)
- PHP 5.5.9 or higher (5.5 recommended). To install the latest version of php, [follow this article](https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/how-to-install-latest-versions-of-php-on-centos/).
- MySQL 5.5.3 or MariaDB 5.5.20
- A super user or any other normal user with sudo privileges.

To meet above requirements, you just need to install LAMP server on your machine. Follow this article to [install LAMP on Fedora](https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/installation-of-lamp-stack-on-centos-7/)

## 1- Configure MySQL/ Mariadb database for Drupal

We need to set up both a database and a user for the Drupal site we will be running.

```
mysql -u root -p
```
> \> CREATE DATABASE microhost\_db;  
> \> CREATE USER microhost\_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '\-----------';  
> \> GRANT ALL ON microhost\_db.\* TO microhost\_user@localhost;  
> \> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  
> \> EXIT;

## 2- Install and configure Drupal

First, we'll use the wget function to get the most recent version of Drupal (i.e. 8.2.6). If you don't already have the wget and tar packages on your computer, use the following command to get them:

```
dnf install wget tar -y
```
```
wget https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-8.0.2.tar.gz
```
Use the command given below to get the file you downloaded from Drupal out of its ZIP format. After that, move the folder with Drupal into the /var/www/html directory, which is the Apache Document Root.

```
tar -zxcf drupal-9.4.6.tar.gz # mv drupal-9.4.6 /var/www/html/drupal
```
Then, in the directory (/var/www/html/drupal/sites/default), create the settings file settings.php based on the example settings file default.settings.php. After that, set the correct permissions on the Drupal site directory, including its subdirectories and files, as shown below:

```
cd /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/
cp default.settings.php settings.php
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/drupal/
```
Finally, at this point, go to the URL: http://server IP/drupal/ to launch the online installer, choose your chosen installation language, and click Save to proceed.

```
http://server-ip/drupal 
```

> Note: if your server have php version lower than 5.6, you will encounter the below error when you hit your server-ip on your browser
