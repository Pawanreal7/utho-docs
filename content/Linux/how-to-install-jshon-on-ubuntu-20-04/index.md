**Description**

In this article, we will acquire new knowledge. How to Install Jshon on [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) 20.04 JSON is a free and open-source command-line utility that can be used to read, generate, and parse JSON documents. It is designed to be a replacement for all of the unstable JSON parsers that are made from grep, sed, and awk, in addition to the heavyweight one-line parsers that are made from Python and Perl. You can load data into Jshon from a file or from the standard input, then execute actions on the data, and finally display the result on the standard output. It is very simple to use and simple to operate with. Additionally, it can be installed on virtually all of the most common operating systems, including Linux. In this section, we are going to examine the procedures required to install Jshon on computers running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
